1. Spin up another new project repo and make a route folder called `product`
2. Inside the `product` folder, create a file named `productsRouter.js` and ensure its integration in `app.js`. The path should be `/api/products`.
3. Within the `product` folder, establish two additional folders named `model` and `controller`.
4. In the `model` folder, create a file named `Product.js`, and in the `controller` folder, create another file named `productController.js`.
5. In `Product.js`, include only `productName` with the type set to string—refer to the existing code for guidance.
6. In `productController.js`, implement the following functions: `createProduct`, `getAllProducts`, `getProductByID`, `updateProductByID`, and `deleteProductByID`.
7. Integrate these functions in `productsRouter.js` with reference to the existing code.
